      <div class="first">
        <h2>Taking breaks</h2>

        <p>It's super important to take frequent breaks- away from your laptop!</p>
        <p>Taking a short walk can make you feel more refreshed, and lead to more efficient revision when you get back.Try working for no longer than 45 minutes consecutively, before taking a 10 minute break.</p>

        <h2>Getting enough sleep</h2>

        <p>Sleep is always important, but especially during revision it can help you stay focused during the day. We also need sleep to form memories and retain information, so it will definitely aid your revision. We recommend at least 7 hours a night, but everyone is different, so find out what works for you!</p>
        <p>The app headspace focuses on relaxation and has some great sections on helping you sleep <a ref="https://www.headspace.com/"></p>

        <h2>Exercising</h2>

        <p>For those longer revision breaks, it can be really useful to get some exercise.</p>
        <p>It is a good destraction from working and gives your brain a break. Maybe try partnering up with some friends to exercise together or take part in group exercise classes, to incorporate socialising into your break too!</p>
